## Features

- `AI Doctor Search` - helps to connect patients and appropriate doctors using patients' cases descriptions. How does it works? Example:

```text

    $ Step 1. User write his case explaination to the Bot. 
    
    Example: I feel bad, becouse of the pain in my back. Yesterday I was riding the bicycle and I fell down on the ground once. Could you help me?

    $ Step 2. The bot tries to extract symptoms from the text and, if it isn‚Äôt an emergency case, it prepares a list of short questions to get more details.

    $ Step 3. After receiving all answers, the bot tries to guess what disease the patient might have using the entire input context.

    $ Step 4. Based on the disease name, the bot replies to the patient with a list of doctors who can help, along with an option to book a session.

```

- `First Aid Guidelines` - explains how to make first aid step by step with pictures.
